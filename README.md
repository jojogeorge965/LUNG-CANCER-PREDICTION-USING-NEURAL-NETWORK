# LUNG CANCER PREDICTION
The main objective of this project is to develop an advanced computer-aided diagnosis system using deep learning algorithms that extract data from CT images and provide an accurate diagnosis of lung cancer. We are building a deep learning network that predicts whether patient has Benign cancer, Malignant caner, or the patient normal with improved accuracy. Finally, the deep learning model is deployed through web application so that it will easily be accessible for the public users.
